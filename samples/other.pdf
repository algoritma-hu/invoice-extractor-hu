# Hungarian Middleware Demo (classify → extract → route → notify)

Drop files into `./samples`, run one command, and they’re sorted into `./out` with logs.  
Invoice extraction currently uses a stub; wire in your real logic in `extractors/hu_invoice.py`.

## Run
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 middleware_demo.py --config config.yaml
